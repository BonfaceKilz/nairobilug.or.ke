Congrats to Muya for being the only one to make it on time. The meetup was just as exciting, at least for me, as most of previous meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Highlights:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a suggestion that the LUG should build a portable 'blood-glucose measuring device that plugs into a phone's audio jack' (I'm sure there's a shorter name for that) as a collaborative project, given the talent in the LUG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was some discussion on WebRTC and its apparent bright future. Somebody even created a group for the LUG on [talky] (https://talky.io/nairobilug). No nudity please ;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No females were present in the meetup. We seriously need to get nerdy girls to come to the meetups. ~~I think~~ I'm certain there are cool girls out there.. somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;September Meetup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nairobi LUG meets every first Saturday of the month. The next meetup will therefore be on the 7th of September. Can't wait :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Rogena</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2014 16:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>tag:nairobilug.or.ke,2014-08-02:2014/08/meetup-august-2014.html</guid><category>KFC</category><category>meetup</category></item></channel></rss>
