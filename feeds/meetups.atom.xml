Congrats to Muya for being the only one to make it on time. The meetup was just as exciting, at least for me, as most of previous meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Highlights:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a suggestion that the LUG should build a portable 'blood-glucose measuring device that plugs into a phone's audio jack' (I'm sure there's a shorter name for that) as a collaborative project, given the talent in the LUG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was some discussion on WebRTC and its apparent bright future. Somebody even created a group for the LUG on [talky] (https://talky.io/nairobilug). No nudity please ;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No females were present in the meetup. We seriously need to get nerdy girls to come to the meetups. ~~I think~~ I'm certain there are cool girls out there.. somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;September Meetup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nairobi LUG meets every first Saturday of the month. The next meetup will therefore be on the 7th of September. Can't wait :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="KFC"></category><category term="meetup"></category></entry><entry><title>Meetup Summary (March, 2014)</title><link href="http://nairobilug.or.ke/2014/03/meetup-march-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-02T21:01:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Alan Orth</name></author><id>tag:nairobilug.or.ke,2014-03-02:2014/03/meetup-march-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;11 or 12 people showed up, including two first-time members (hi, Ken and friend!).  Off the top of my head, the topics discussed included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Serious stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using GPG Public Keys for signing and encrypting emails (standards, terminology, motivation, etc)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several members have, in the last weeks, set up and exchanged keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling a key-signing party where attendees bring their photo IDs and GPG public key IDs so people can verify that their real identity matches their GPG identity on the GPG Public Key Infrastructure and then "sign" eachother's keys&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could be Saturday, March 8th?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to make a push to educate people (via blog post?) so they are prepared for the party (don't come with laptops or expecting to create/publish keys!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling a second, more formal LUG meetup every month; perhaps seminars or "lightning" talks&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea would be to give people a forum to share technical things they're doing, and let people practice public speaking skills etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venue should be somewhere in tao to make it easy for people to be on time, possibly University of Nairobi library (with KENET connections?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps could be the 3rd Saturday of the month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not-so-serious stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress of the current Nairobi GNU/Linux Users Group book club book, Stephen King's &lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt;.  sticky and sentinelprime are ~50% through, but emk and raywan haven't started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emk's gangsta beard will rival that of Rick Ross soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper pronunciation of "Linux" (&lt;a href="http://safalra.com/science/linguistics/linux-pronunciation/"&gt;Linus says "Lih-nux"&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wat?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper pronunciation of "doge"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof that it happened:&lt;/p&gt;

I had a friend attend for the first time and he liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3D printer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well great news guys have decided to build a 3D printer. Updates on that will be blogged about sooner than later I hope. I for one are very excited that we're doing such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;emk breaks opSec&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he decided to show up after hiding for a very very long while. He wanted it noted that he refrained from kicking zipper's teeth in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has a gangsta beard which was totally unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was talk of getting devices into the country as a group with eebrah fascilitating that. This was very exciting since it would bring prices down for most things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;r0ckwilda{-_-} shared some interesting things he is doing with blender. I can't wait to see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly this time I didn't get a chance to hear Karibe talk about Physics and electronics. I always look forward to those that's for sure. You can't beat having a physicist around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh plus everyone is talking about a book called the stand. It's really big and that just makes everyone love it haha I kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of theBOFH was noted with great concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noted that there wasn't much talk/argument on distros. I always like those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some cool pics from the event that was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fedora 20 beta (and therefore final) &lt;a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2013-October/190689.html"&gt;being delayed by one week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How POSIX is limiting innovation (and the creep of "Linux-isms" into POSIX)&lt;/li&gt;
