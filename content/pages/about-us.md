Summary: About the Nairobi GNU/Linux User Group.

The Nairobi GNU/Linux Users Group (Nairobi LUG) is a not-for-profit community serving the greater Nairobi area. We are a collection of people dedicated to GNU/Linux, Free Software, Open Source, and related topics. Members meet regularly (in person) at various meetup locations, and participate in our email discussion list. Through participation in the LUG forums, we combine our efforts to both teach and disseminate information, allowing us to better understand and control the open source world we are using, building and promoting to others.

We traditionally meet on the first Saturday of every month between 04.00 ~ 06.00 pm EAT (GMT +3) at KFC Kimathi Street. All meetups are free and open to the public.

Access to other Linux users is often the most valuable part of participation in a user group. The long term members of the group, many of which have years experience using Linux and other Unix-like operating systems (BSD etc.), can provide insight and ideas that only a seasoned professional would have.

You can join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/nairobi-gnu), where meetups are announced and other general LUG conversation takes place. You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nairobilug). Lastly if you prefer a more real-time medium, you can chat to us on IRC. We're on the Freenode network and the channel name is [#nairobilug](irc://chat.freenode.net/#nairobilug). Details are listed on our [contact page]({filename}/pages/contact.md).

**There is no level of technical expertise required to attend meetups** and we pride ourselves on being open and friendly to all. We're just as likely to be found talking about the latest film releases, music or anything else as hardcore techy topics.

Whether you're a hardened kernel hacker, or you've just used Firefox a few times and wonder what Open Source is, it's all the same to us. Come and get involved!

Have a look at our website, then come on out to a meetup and see what we can do for each other. Happy open-sourcing!
