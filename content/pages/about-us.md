Summary: About the Nairobi GNU/Linux User Group.

The Nairobi GNU/Linux Users Group is a not-for-profit community serving the greater Nairobi area. We are a collection of people dedicated to GNU/Linux, Free Software, Open Source, and related topics. Our goals include education, advocacy, support and community.

We traditionally meet the first Saturday of every month between 04.00 – 06.00 pm EAT (GMT +3) at KFC Kimathi Street. All meetings are free and open to the public.

Lastly if you prefer a more real-time medium, you can chat to us on IRC. We’re on the **Freenode** network and the channel name is **#nairobilug**. Details are listed on the contact page.

## Meetups

**There is no level of technical expertise required to attend meetups** and we pride ourselves on being open and friendly to all. We’re just as likely to be found talking about the latest film releases, music or anything else as hardcore techy topics.

Whether you’re a hardened kernel hacker, or you’ve just used Firefox a few times and wonder what Open Source is, it’s all the same to us. Come and get involved!
