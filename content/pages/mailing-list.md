Summary: Nairobi GNU/Linux User Group mailing list.

The primary day-to-day method of communication with the LUG is done via a mailing list. It is the centre of NairobiLUG activity.

## What Is It?

A mailing list is a service that sends e-mail out to everyone else who is subscribed. To ask a question, or help answer one, you simply send your e-mail to a special e-mail address. Your e-mail is then sent out to all the mailing list subscribers. Other members can then reply to the original e-mail by sending their reply to the same mailing list e-mail address. That reply is then also sent out to all the subscribers. A conversation-like dialog develops, and every member can learn from, or contribute to, the discussion.

If you're confused by that description, then try the list out for a week or so and you'll soon pick it up!
