###As it happened,insider info

* There was talk that everyone should try to watch the movie citizen four.An Eye opening documentary on privacy,surveillance and obviously the bigger picture.
* Jason talked of making an open source platform for doing route interconnection machine learning platform to decide how to effectively decide on what matatus to take and in what order that would yield the highest probability to reach a destination that couldn't be reached from a single direct matatu or a fixed route public vehicle from a general place say x .
* Allan mentioned that the reason that Mozilla, or any modern browser has been so slow was that everyone was using the same adblock add-on that and suggested people switch to [u-block](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to effectively use less RAM by upto two-thirds in some tests.
* Lots of other questions,laughs and more...among friends.
